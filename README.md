# countryExplorer

The CSS code defines a styling system for a web application using CSS variables for color management. It starts by establishing a root set of variables that include colors for primary elements, backgrounds, text, and hover states.

General styles are applied universally to remove default margins and paddings, ensuring consistency across browsers. The body is styled to use a flexible layout that occupies the full height of the viewport with a light background color.

Scrollbar styles are customized for aesthetics, setting the width and colors of the scrollbar elements. The header is given a primary color background with white text and center alignment.

The navigation bar employs flexbox to arrange items, providing spacing and alignment. Links within the navigation are styled for visibility, with hover effects to enhance interactivity.

Input fields for searching and sorting are styled with padding, borders, and background colors for a clean appearance. The countries container utilizes flexbox to manage the layout of country cards, allowing them to wrap and maintain consistent spacing.

Country cards are designed with borders, rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects to improve user experience. Modal styles cover the viewport with a semi-transparent background, focusing attention on the content within.

Modal content is styled for visual appeal, with background colors, margins, and animations for a smooth entrance. The close button is designed to be prominent and easily accessible, with color changes on interaction.

The footer shares the color scheme of the rest of the application, ensuring visual coherence. Responsive design is addressed with media queries, adjusting styles for different screen sizes to maintain usability on various devices.
